Ib is an island nation off the northeastern coast of Essos, surrounded by the polar waters of the Shivering Sea. It is several thousand miles east of Westeros. It is one of the largest islands in the known world, and part of an archipelago with a few much smaller islands.

In its remote location and harsh living conditions, the local Ibbenese are a hardy folk who maintain a large fleet of whaling ships which spread far across the world's oceans. Ibbenese whaling ships visit ports in both Westeros and the Free Cities, and are even seen as far south as the Summer Islands.

Although far away from mainland Essos, Ibben is much too small to be considered a continent in its own right, so it is loosely considered part of Essos. Understandably it has a much colder climate than the Dothraki Sea.

The capital and major city of Ib island is the Port of Ibben (also called just "Ibben").

The island is very large, apparently near in size to Dorne or the Disputed Lands. It is irregularly shaped but is more or less longest along a line running from southwest to northeast. Ib is at roughly the same longitude as Vaes Dothrak and Qarth - loosely almost as wide on a map as the Red Waste is. The island is slightly north of the latitude of White Harbor in the North, but its most northern point does not extend much farther than Skagos island.

Despite these vast distances, the whale-hunting, Inuit-like Ibbenese travel very far across the world's oceans, trading across much of Essos and sometimes in Westeros as well. The Port of Ibben is on the island's south-eastern coast
