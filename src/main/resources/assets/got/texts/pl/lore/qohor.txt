Qohor is one of the nine Free Cities in western Essos, located between the Narrow Sea and the grasslands held by the Dothraki. It is several weeks' ride east of Pentos on the western edge of the vast Forest of Qohor.

Like most of the Free Cities (except for Braavos), Qohor was founded as a colony of the Valyrian Freehold, specifically as a religious center for worship of the deity known as the Black Goat.

People from Qohor are known as Qohorik. The city itself is renowned for its immensely skilled blacksmiths, who possess the rare knowledge of how to reforge Valyrian steel.

Like the other Free Cities, Qohor originated as a colony of the Valyrian Freehold.

After the Doom of Valyria, four hundred years prior to the War of the Five Kings, Valyria's outlying colonies were thrown into chaos. This period of civil wars between the Free Cities and invasions from without is remembered as the Century of Blood.

Without the Valyrians and their dragons to hold them in check anymore, mounted Dothraki hordes burst forth from the central plains of Essos, rampaging across the continent. Khal Temmo led his khalasar numbering in the tens of thousands towards Qohor, intending to raze the city completely. However, the horde was decisively defeated in the resulting Battle of Qohor by 3,000 Unsullied warrior-eunuchs purchased from Astapor in Slaver's Bay. Temmo himself as well as his sons were killed, and Qohor was saved.

Qohor is still the closest of the Free Cities to the Dothraki Sea, but ever since Temmo's defeat it has been guarded by a standing garrison of Unsullied purchased from Slaver's Bay.
