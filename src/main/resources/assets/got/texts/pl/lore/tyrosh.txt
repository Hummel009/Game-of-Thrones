Tyrosh is one of the Free Cities located to the east of Westeros. It is situated on an island at the eastern end of the Stepstones, an island chain that extends across the Narrow Sea. According to legend, there used to be a land-bridge linking Westeros and Essos, of which the Steptones are the only remnants. Therefore, Tyrosh is the closest of the Free Cities to Westeros, located not far from Dorne and the island of Tarth (off the coast of the Stormlands).

Due to its central location - between Westeros and the other Free Cities, and its proximity to constant wars between Lys and Myr in the Disputed Lands - Tyrosh is often seen as a major world hub for hiring the services of various professional mercenary companies, to serve in the various conflicts of these different regions.

Tyrosh is also well-known for its pear-brandy.

People from Tyrosh are known as Tyroshi. Tyroshi are known for wearing bright colors and have a reputation of being insatiably greedy. They speak a bastardized version of High Valyrian.
