House Baratheon of Dragonstone is an extinct cadet branch of the original House Baratheon of Storm's End and was the ruling house of the island of Dragonstone after the defeat of House Targaryen in Robert's Rebellion. Stannis Baratheon, the head of the house and the Lord of Dragonstone, was a claimant to the Iron Throne in the War of the Five Kings.

Their seat was the island fortress of Dragonstone in Blackwater Bay. The houses of Blackwater Bay, also known as the Lords of the Narrow Sea, are sworn directly to Dragonstone.

Following the deaths of Stannis, Selyse and Shireen Baratheon, House Baratheon of Dragonstone has become officially extinct and leaving the lordship over Dragonstone vacant. House Targaryen retook the island as part of their reconquest of Westeros and the parent house of this branch of House Baratheon revived when the bastard son of Robert Baratheon, Gendry was legitimized by Queen Daenerys Targaryen and she granted him the lordship over Storm's End.

Their house words were "Ours Is the Fury," which they shared with their overlords and fellow cadet branches. However, the most common saying of the house was "For The Night is Dark and Full of Terrors." This was also a common saying of followers of R'hllor, the Lord of Light, who was the official religion of the house due to the influence of the Red Priestess Melisandre.

House Baratheon became the ruling house of the Seven Kingdoms when Stannis's brother Robert Baratheon deposed King Aerys II Targaryen. Stannis fought for Robert in the preceding civil war. He was besieged within the family seat Storm's End. When the siege was lifted Stannis took Dragonstone, the seat of House Targaryen. He was awarded the castle as his own by Robert but was slighted when Storm's End was given to his younger brother Renly Baratheon. Stannis served Robert as Master of Ships on his small council.
