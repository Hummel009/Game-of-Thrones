You think you can stop me? I'll throw you to the rats!
You think you can stand up to me? I'll crush you to the ground!
You think I'm afraid of your pathetic efforts? I'll crush you like a bug!
How dare you stand in my way? I will crush you to dust!
How dare you stand up to me? I'll finish you off slowly and painfully!
You won't live if you don't get out of here immediately!
I'll rip out your throat with my teeth and throw your body to the dogs to eat!
I'll rip out your heart and throw it to the crows!
I'll break your back and leave you to die in the mud!
I'll tear out your eyes myself and feed them to the wolves!
