Damn, #, you've got some serious skills when you put your mind to it. Consider this your well-deserved reward. Now, I gotta bounce.
#, you pulled off a smooth move, my man. Stealing's in your blood. Take this as your cut. Appreciate it, bro.
Heh, you're a slick operator, I'll give you that. Didn't think you had it in you to score the whole damn thing. Here's your piece of the pie.
Well, well, #. Looks like the operation went off without a hitch. You got a knack for this dirty work, my respects to you, man.
Eh, #, you really caught me off guard. Not often I come across a thief as crafty as you. Swing by again if you want more action.
Thanks, brother, for your stellar work. You handled that job like a seasoned pro. Here's your fair share of the spoils.
Nice one, #! You showed everyone that stealing is your damn business. Here's your cut, enjoy it.
Ha, you really pulled it off, #. Stealing's like second nature to you. Here's your well-earned reward, and remember, my crew's got your back if you need another job.
You blew my mind, brother. You're a true artist when it comes to thieving. Pure criminal flair, right there.
That's some fine work, little fella. Impressive. Pleasure doing business with you.
