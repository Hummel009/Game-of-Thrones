Are you really an ally, #?
Prove that you can be trusted, and I will trade with you.
Only trusted persons can trade with me.
You need to prove your loyalty to trade with me.
You have to make a name for yourself in our country, and then I will trust you.
You have to show your intelligence, honor and conscience, and then we will bargain.
I don't trust you enough yet to talk about anything more.
I can't know for sure that you're for us, #.
I'm not going to just take the word of the first person I meet...
I only trade with supporters of our people, #. I don't do favors for leftist tramps.
