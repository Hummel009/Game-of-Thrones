I share in your dismay, for the vile scoundrel has yet to face the consequences he deserves.
I had expected to witness the resolution of this tale by now, but the miscreant continues to elude the grasp of justice.
The miscreant must face the repercussions of his wicked deeds. Once again, I wish you good fortune in your pursuit!
I cannot hide my sorrow and discontent at seeing the villainous knave still alive and unpunished.
The scoundrel persists in evading the retribution he rightfully deserves. It seems the task has proven more challenging than anticipated.
My anger and sadness intertwine as I observe the scoundrel escaping the punishment he is due. Your task is not yet complete.
Once again, wickedness prevails unchallenged... I pray that you find a way to administer justice.
My heart is burdened with sorrow and despair, as the wretch still breathes and walks upon this earth. You must act swiftly.
Sadness clings to me like a shadow until the wretch bears the penalty he has earned. Pursue him with all your might!
My hopes were shattered upon learning that the scoundrel has not yet made amends for his malevolence. You must persevere in your pursuit.
