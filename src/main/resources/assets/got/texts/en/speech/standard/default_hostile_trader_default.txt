Don't even expect me to indulge your desires. My goods are for our people only!
Don't expect me to cooperate with you. My customers are only our people, not traitors like you!
Do you really expect me to let you, a stranger, touch my goods? Get out of here at once!
Your money means nothing to me. I'm not going to help the enemies of my people, so get out!
Your coins are worthless to me. I'm not going to sell you a single item!
Your requests are as empty as your hope that I will trade with you. Get out of my sight!
You think I'll trade with a stranger like you? Take your money and get out of here!
You dare to demand goods from me? How dare you! Get out of my sight, stranger!
You dare to come here to my shop? Get out or I'll call the others!
You dare to come here thinking I'll sell you something? Go away!
