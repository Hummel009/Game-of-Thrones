Don't even expect me to indulge your desires. My goods are for our people only!
Don't expect me to cooperate with you. My customers are only our people, not traitors like you!
How dare you come here to my shop? Get out or I'll call the others!
Do you think I'll let you, an enemy, touch my goods? Get out of here at once!
Your money means nothing to me. I'm not going to help lying creatures, so get out!
Your coins are worthless to me. I'm not going to sell you a single item!
Your requests are as empty as your hope that I will trade with you. Get out of my sight!
You think I'll trade with a pathetic brat like you? Take your money and get out of here!
Have you come to demand goods from me? How dare you, you scum! Get out of my sight, #!
You dare come here thinking I'm gonna sell you anything? Get out of here!
