#, listen to me # There are dangerous people walking around here. Stay out of their way if you value your life.
Remember, force and cunning rule here. If you want to survive, you'd better stay away from me.
It's best not to push your luck and go your own way.
We're strangers. You better stay out of my business.
You'd better stay out of the way of those who know every stone here.
You don't look out of place. That's good, it means you and I won't be in competition. Go on your way.
You seem like a nice man. But this place is full of bad people, so keep your head down and stay out of their business.
You're not from around here. That's good, so our interests don't overlap. Just walk on by.
You're not from around here, I can tell. It's every man for himself here, so be on your guard and mind your own business.
I can see you're not from around here. You better mind your own business if you want to stay alive.
