Run while you can!
Fear for your life, you weakling!
Damn you, rat!
Death to you and your kin!
Your cries will not be heard by your filthy kindred!
You belong with the meat roasting on my fire!
Now your fate belongs to our lords, #!
You will squeal like the rest of the enemy rats!
You will bleed and die quickly, #!
You are an enemy of our people. Death awaits you!
You're no friend of ours, #!
You are not one of us. Run, you scum!
Die, scum!
What kind of fiend are you?
I've seen tougher nuts than you, #!
I'll cut you alive!
I'll crush your skull with my fist, you scum!
I'll smash your face in!
I'll break your legs, and then you won't be able to run anymore!
I'll skin you like a rabbit!
