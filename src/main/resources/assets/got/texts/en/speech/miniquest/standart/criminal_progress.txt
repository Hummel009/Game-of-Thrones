Damn, #, you're more useless than a snitch on a payroll. Can't believe you still ain't got our damn valuables back. Even little girls run circles around you!
I had high hopes for you, #, but you turned out to be a sorry excuse for a criminal. You're like a dime-a-dozen chump I see on every street corner.
What the hell, #?! It's been ages, and you still can't deliver on your damn promise? You oughta be ashamed of yourself, you spineless rat.
You looked like a pro, but you're nothing more than a scared little punk. Get off your lazy ass and find some real work!
How the hell did a pathetic lowlife like you end up here? You couldn't even steal a damn candy bar without tripping over your own feet.
You're a damn embarrassment, #. Everyone had high hopes for you, and you're just a letdown. You disappoint us all.
You managed to surpass even my lowest expectations, #. Is there any shred of hope left for you, or are you just destined to be a piece of trash?
You're a complete failure, #. I thought you had some semblance of skill, but I was dead wrong. You're just worthless garbage. Don't you agree? Prove me wrong, if you can!
I'm downright disappointed in you, #. You couldn't live up to the hype and showed your true worthlessness. It's a damn disgrace.
I made a mistake putting my trust in you, #. I wasted my precious time, and you turned out to be a big fat zero in all of this. Well, keep stumbling along, and maybe you'll stumble upon something worthwhile...
