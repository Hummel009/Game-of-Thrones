I am disappointed that the scoundrel has not yet received the punishment he deserves.
I had hoped to see the end of this story by now, but the scoundrel continues to evade justice.
The scoundrel must pay for his misdeeds. Once again I wish you good luck!
I cannot hide my grief and disappointment to see that the scoundrel is still alive.
The scoundrel continues to avoid the retribution he deserves. I see that the job has proved more difficult for you.
I feel anger and sadness to see the scoundrel evade punishment. Your work is not yet done.
Evil goes unpunished again... I hope you find a way to do justice.
I am sad and depressed, for the wretch is still alive and walking the roundabout. You must hurry.
Sadness will not leave me until the wretch is given the punishment he deserves. Hunt him down!
My hopes were dashed when I heard that the scoundrel had not yet paid for his wickedness. You must keep fighting.
