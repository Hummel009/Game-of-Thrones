Your enemies are our enemies, #!
Lead us into battle!
Where's the fight, #? I want to kill!
Let's stain the ground with blood!
Let us burn their houses to the ground!
My weapons crave a split head!
We fight for you, #!
The roar of battle awaits!
You are a great warrior, # Lead us to victory.
You mighty warrior, #!
Scars await us in the battle to come, #
I can almost taste the wretched blood of our enemies.
I want to crush their skulls under my foot!
