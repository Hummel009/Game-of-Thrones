In the old days we lived in peace and harmony, but those times are long gone....
Indeed, things were better in the old days.
Come on, #, tell me something funny.
I think we're all gonna be drunk soon.
Have you got any good news, #?
Life's getting better, life's getting more fun.
Life should be easy.
Hello, #. What business brings you here?
Every winter, a cold darkness descends on half the world.
Everyone who doesn't have a horse dreams of buying one. Everyone who has a horse dreams of selling it. And he doesn't do it because he'll be without a horse.
I think we've met before. Or am I mistaken?
How are you doing?
What tidings do you bring with you?
I was once on a road of adventure, and then I got shot in the knee.
People flee from one land to another, away from conflict.
Few things are better than the first rays of the sun.
Have no fear, my friend. You can trust me.
I won't bore you with old stories of the good old days.
Don't be sorry, my friend, I don't recognize you.
Well, well, well.
The right person in the wrong place can turn the world upside down.
Where you from, #?
Nice day today, isn't it?
Greetings, #!
Rise and shine, Mr. #, rise and shine. No, I don't mean you sleep on the job. No one deserves rest more than you.
You're not from around here, are you, #?
Nature has no bad weather, #. Every weather is a blessing.
Have you got anything to drink?
I've got to get back to work, #. To do what's right, to do what's wrong.
I hope to die at an advanced age.
