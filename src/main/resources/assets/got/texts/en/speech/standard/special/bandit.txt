Stand and deliver! Your money... or your life!
Hand over the goods, #!
I wouldn't put up a fight if I was you!
I'll be filthy stinkin' rich after I'm done with you!
You won't be needin' all them things, will you now?
Well look what we've got here!
Time to pay!
Where are you hiding those pretty little coins?
Come here! I want to make a deal with you... 
Your money is mine, maggot! Pay up!
What is that shining in your pocket? Is that a coin? Give it to me!
