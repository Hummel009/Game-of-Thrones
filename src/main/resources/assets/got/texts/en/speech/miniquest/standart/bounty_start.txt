Rumor has it that there is a killer $ in these lands, robbing and killing our people. And I know, # that you are the arbiter of justice. You know what to do!
My lady commissioned me to find someone who could help her. She refused some noble lord, and he hired an assassin to deal with her. I can't let that happen. Will you help me, #? All suspicion falls on $.
Look, I-I can't tell you who I serve. Help me, man. Kill the $, please. This h-human is dangerous!
Meiga told me I'd be killed by a man named $. She was never wrong, #! She predicted the death of my father, my sister and even my dog. I don't want to die! Will you help me eliminate my killer?
Listen carefully, #. There's a bastard who kills maids near my lord's domain. If you see who's doing it, kill him. My lord will thank you.
There's a brigand in our village stealing the jewels of the nobles. Help me eliminate him, #.
I'm going to run away from my family and go to a distant land, # but my father is not happy about it, because I carry his dirty secrets with me. A murderer is after me. I need your help to survive.
A midwife has escaped from our domain who knows the truth about the origins of some of my mother's children. Angry, she sent an assassin after her, but Aunt Velma has always been good to me... I do not want my mother's secrets to be the cause of her death. Help me get rid of the murderer before he gets to the midwife, #.
My lord asked me to tell him if I saw a strong warrior. You see, # he's a powerful man who lends to many people. But my lord doesn't like debtors very much. $ owes him, #. Kill him.
I owe money to the lord, and my business is ruined! I'm finished! That's what he said. He said if I dare run away, he'd hire a man to kill me. I'm trying to get away, but I'm not comfortable... Please don't let him kill me! Kill him first!
