Don't expect me to help you. My men fight only for those they care about, not strangers like you!
Do you really think I'd let you use my soldiers against their own people? You are a fool if you think I would do such a thing!
Leave our lands before I order my men to tear you apart! Your presence here is unwelcome!
Your attempts to persuade me are doomed to failure. My men will stay with me. They fight for their own, not strangers like you.
Your words are as empty as your intentions. You will never earn the trust of my men, so don't even try!
Your presence here offends me. You think I'd let you take my men? They are loyal only to me and my people!
You don't understand our people, our traditions and values. That's why I will never give you my men!
You dare to come here, stranger? Go away before I order my men to pierce you with arrows!
You defy our traditions, and therefore you are an enemy. Get out of my sight before I throw you out of here by force!
Did you come here thinking you could buy my men? Forget it! They are loyal to me to the end!
