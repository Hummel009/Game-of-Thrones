Don't expect me to help you. My men only fight for those they care about, not traitors like you!
You think I'd let you take my men? They are loyal only to me and my people!
How dare you come here, you lying bitch? You think you can buy my men? Forget it! They are loyal to me to the end!
Do you really think I'll let you use my warriors against their own people? You're a fool if you think I would do such a thing!
Leave our lands before I order my men to tear you apart! Get out of my sight!
Your attempts to persuade me are doomed to failure. My men will stay with me. They fight for their own, not my enemies!
Your words are as empty as your intentions. You will never earn the trust of my men, so don't even try!
You dare come here, #? Get out before I order my men to pierce you with arrows!
You are a cowardly, sneaky, pathetic brat. That's why I will never give you my soldiers!
You kill us and our allies, you are the enemy! Get out of my sight before I throw you out of here by force!
