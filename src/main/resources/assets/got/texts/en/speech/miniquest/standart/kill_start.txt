Greetings, #. Oh, I didn't think I'd see you now. These are hard times. War, death, enemies and traitors all around. Our country must stand! # Won't you join our army?
# But I'll show you from where our country was being attacked. And if a preemptive strike had not been made six hours before the operation on the positions--four positions, I'll show you the map now, I brought--they would have attacked our troops. So we didn't start this war, our conscience is clear. It's a good thing we started it. Join us!
