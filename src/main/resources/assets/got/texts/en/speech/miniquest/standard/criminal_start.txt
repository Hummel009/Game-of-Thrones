Hey, #. It looks like that sneaky bastard Niko Bellic swiped all our cash and vanished, leaving us high and dry. I'm in desperate need of a partner in crime to help us out. Are you up for it?
Yo, #! I got a sweet opportunity for us. The Ballas gang is on our tails, so we had to ditch our hideout along with the guns. We're broke as hell now, but here's the plan: you pull off a major heist and grab something real valuable, then we split the loot. I'll supply the firepower. Sound good?
Listen up, #. Word on the street is that our rivals from the neighboring hood are dealing some seriously valuable merchandise, and it's messing with our operation. I need you to handle it. Swipe that stuff and deliver it to us, and we'll make it worth your while.
We've been hunting down this big shot trader for a minute now, #. The dude's been hoarding all sorts of precious goods. He's super possessive and sleeps with his loot like it's his lover. Can you make his life easier? Help us snatch his stash, and there'll be a handsome reward for you.
Some punks from the opposing crew jacked our precious valuables and flipped them for cash, #. We want our stuff back, and we'll make it worth your time if you can retrieve it for us.
Yo, #! Me and my crew are thinking of retiring, you know what I'm saying? We wanna open up a kickass joint, but we need resources we ain't got the cash for. Can you help us out by snatching something valuable?
We got our eyes on a badass thief who wants to join our crew, he-he. She's down, but she's got one condition: we gotta find something real valuable for her. Can you lend a hand, #?
There's a rival gang causing trouble, demanding a fat stack of cash for the release of a hostage. We gotta pay up and get the hell out of here, but we ain't got the dough. Help us figure this mess out, #!
The boss wants me to score some stuff, but I'm feeling sick as hell and can't go on a mission... Can you grab it for me, #?
I'm a pro thief on the border, #. I can snatch goods from neighboring towns without ending up in the slammer. But damn, I'm broke right now, and the border is far as hell. Stealing from our own turf ain't an option. I'm too scared of getting caught. Help me out, swipe something valuable, and I'll sell it to buy a sweet ride.
