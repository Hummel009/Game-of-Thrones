Save your soul if you can.
What do I see? Another soul searching...
Do not suffer, my child.
They have become like those demons that exist in the flesh, but in which there is no light.
May the brightest light illuminate your path!
A shepherd must stay with his flock. 
Have you seen my flock, #?
The days of my life have melted like smoke, and my bones are scorched like ashes, so let the dirt of my soul feed the fire until nothing but light remains.
I will watch over you, I can promise nothing more.
The traps of evil are treacherous. But, by the light, mine are even better!
Woe to us! For our abode is far away, and we wander through a haven of chaos.
I waste my strength in places that were foreign to me. I am filled with afflictions, and my enemies attack me without cause.
And let them call me mad, for thou art my help, strength, and salvation.
May your will be done, light! I bless your glory by day and in the darkness of night!
I pray you never turn away your light! Listen to me and set traps for my enemies when I ask for help!
Do not turn your countenance away from me! Bow your head and listen to me when I cry out to you in sorrow!
From my groans my bones are clinging to my flesh.
Their souls are filled with evil! And, like this place, must be cleansed!
The dead know not sleep in their graves! And you do not remember them until your hands destroy them.
I release you, my child.
