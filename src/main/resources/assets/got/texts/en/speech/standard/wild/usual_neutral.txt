I don't believe you, #!
My men fight only with true warriors.
What makes you think you can lead my warriors into battle, #?
You've killed too few enemy rats, #.
Your hands aren't sprinkled with blood, # You're not fit to lead us.
Prove your strength in battle and only then will my men follow you.
Spill more blood, # and then you will be worthy of my men.
My men raise their axes for real warriors. You are not a true warrior.
The horror of battle is no match for weaklings like you, #.
My strong men do not follow weak leaders.
You haven't spilled enough blood, #.
You're weak as a rat! Go and kill. Then my men can fight for you, #.
