What does that mean?!
Run while you're still alive, #.
Enemies have no place in our land!
You fool!
We don't like bandits here!
Go away, #!
No pity for the likes of you!
You're not welcome here!
Go away, you filthy scum!
Get out of here, #!
Get out!
Why did you come here?
You are to be executed!
Surrender! Drop your weapon!
Damn you, #!
Your place is in the penitentiary, #!
Get out of here!
You'd better leave of your own free will, #.
You won't get away with it, that's for sure.
You vile creature.
You're no friend of mine.
You won't live to see the sunset!
You're a criminal!
Get out of my sight, #!
What do you want, scum?
Repent, #!
I advise you to get out of here, #.
