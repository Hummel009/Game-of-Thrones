There is nothing more disgusting than not being able to protect the one you love.
It is better to fight than to sit and wait.
You don't feel helpless in battle. There you have a horse and a sword and even an axe. And you're in armor, so you're not so easy to hurt.
No one has ever taught me how to fight, but I can kill any warrior in one-on-one combat.
To be a knight is a rare and precious gift.
