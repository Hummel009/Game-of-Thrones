When snow falls and white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack lives.
Courtesy is a lady's armor.
I do not love Joffrey.
A true lady will not allow herself to pay attention to a man's appearance, no matter how ugly he may be.
Love ensures the loyalty of a people more reliably than fear.
Pity kills desire.
I wish we could go back to that day and shout to ourselves, "Stop, silly!"
The most courageous thing we can do now is to face the truth.
