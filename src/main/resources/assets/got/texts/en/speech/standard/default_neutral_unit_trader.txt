You know, I'm not sure you can provide my people with what they need. They're not used to unreliable masters.
You know, I've heard some things about your past dealings that don't make me feel very confident. I need to get to know you better before I make up my mind.
I'm sorry, but I need to know more about you before I decide if you're reliable enough to hire my men.
My guys are used to working only with people we trust. Your reputation doesn't inspire that trust yet.
Your persistence is noted, but it doesn't guarantee you'll be able to provide my men with what they need. I must weigh the risks.
Your reputation is of questionable standing. My fighters are accustomed to working only with those we trust.
You can offer good pay, but I'm concerned about your ability to keep your promise. My fighters deserve better.
Hmm, so you want to hire my men? Well, let me first assess whether you're worthy of their services.
I don't doubt your intentions, but I need assurances you can keep your promises. My men need stability.
I appreciate your offer, but my fighters aren't just mercenaries. They deserve to work with someone we can fully trust. Until you convince me of that.
