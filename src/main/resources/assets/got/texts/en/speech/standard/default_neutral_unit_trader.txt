You know, I'm not sure your reputation is spotless. My fighters aren't used to unreliable masters.
You know, I've heard some things about your past dealings that don't exactly add to my confidence. I need to get to know you better before I make up my mind.
I'm sorry, but I need to know more about you before I decide if you're trustworthy enough to hire my men.
My guys are used to working only with people we trust. Your reputation doesn't inspire that trust yet.
Your persistence is noted, but that doesn't guarantee your reputation is high. I must weigh the risks.
Your reputation causes me doubt. My fighters are accustomed to working only with those we trust.
You can offer good pay, but I care about your loyalty. My men deserve the best commanders.
Hmm, you want to hire my men? Well, let me first assess whether you're a worthy man.
I don't doubt your intentions, but I need assurances you're not a traitor or an enemy. My men need stability.
I appreciate your offer, but my men are not just brave warriors. They deserve to work with someone we can fully trust.
