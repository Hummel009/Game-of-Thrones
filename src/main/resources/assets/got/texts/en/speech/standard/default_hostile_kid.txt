Don't even think I'm gonna be friends with you. You're not one of us!
Don't you dare lay a hand on me, stranger! I hate you!
Your presence here makes me uneasy. You're not one of us, so get out!
Your words are as false as you are. Go away or I'll call the grown-ups!
You think I'm going to play with you? You're a stranger, an enemy of our people!
You disgust me! Go away, or I'll call Daddy to send you away!
I won't talk to you. You're an enemy of our people, and I don't believe you!
I won't let you come near me! Go away or I won't call my father!
I hate you with all my heart! Go away and don't come back!
I'll never accept you, you're just a stranger! Leave me alone!
