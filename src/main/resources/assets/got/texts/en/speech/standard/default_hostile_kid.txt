Don't even think I'll be friends with you. You're a traitor!
Don't you dare lay a hand on me, #! I hate you!
You make me sick and scared! Go away, or I'll call my daddy to send you away!
Don't come near me! Go away or I'll call my father!
You think I'm going to play with you? I don't play with my enemies!
You'll always be my enemy! Leave me alone!
I won't talk to you. I don't trust you or your kind!
I hate you with all my heart! Go away and don't come back!
I'll never trust a liar. Go away or I'll call the grown-ups!
I'm afraid of you, your presence makes me tense. Go away!
