You despicable bastard! You dare to stand in my way?
May a curse fall upon you and you perish in agony!
By the saints, your doom is near!
Pray for heavenly forgiveness, for you cannot escape earthly forgiveness.
Pray to your gods, for they will not save you from my sword.
Your mortal body will be food for crows!
Your miserable existence is at an end, you wretched degenerate!
I'll use your face as a sole for my boots!
Your place is on the gallows, unworthy worm!
Your cries for mercy will fill my heart with joy!
Your days are numbered, you wretched brat, prepare to die!
Your howls will amuse me as I torment you!
Your bones will adorn my armor, you wretch!
Your pleas for mercy will only give me more pleasure!
Your pleas for mercy will not save you from my steel!
Your remains will rot and no one will remember your name, you despicable traitor!
Your head will be a decoration on a spear, traitor!
Your death will be slow and painful, as you deserve, you wretched worm!
Tremble, wretched coward, for your end is near!
You will know true terror when my blade pierces your flesh!
You asked for your own end, you vile worm!
I will kill you long and painfully so that you may taste your death one drop at a time!
I will drink from your skull until my thirst for vengeance is quenched!
I will gouge out your eyes and feed them to the ravens, you despicable one!
I will behead you and put your head on display!
I will crush your bones and scatter them to the wind!
I'll crush your bones and throw the corpses to the dogs!
I will cut you in two and throw your parts to the dogs!
I'll tear you to pieces with pleasure, you cowardly dog!
I'll crunch your bones like dry branches!
