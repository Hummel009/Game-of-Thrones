You despicable creature! You dare stand in my way?
May the curse fall upon you and you perish in torment!
By the saints, your doom is near!
Pray for heavenly forgiveness, for you cannot escape earthly forgiveness.
Pray to your gods, but they will not save you from my sword.
Your mortal body will be food for crows!
Your miserable existence is at an end!
I will use your face as a sole for my boots!
Your place is on the gallows, you unworthy creature!
Your cries for mercy will fill my heart with joy!
Your days are numbered, you wretched brat, prepare to die!
Your howls will amuse me as I torment you!
Your bones will adorn my armor, you wretched brat!
Your pleas for mercy will only give me more pleasure!
Your pleas for mercy will not save you from my steel!
Your remains will rot and no one will remember your name, you despicable traitor!
Your head will be a decoration on a spear, traitor!
Your death will be slow and painful, as you deserve, you wretched creature!
Tremble, you wretched creature, for your end is near!
You are asking for your end, you unworthy creature!
You will know true horror when my blade pierces your flesh!
I will kill you long and painfully, so that death may come to you drop by drop!
I will drink from your skull until my thirst for vengeance is quenched!
I will gouge out your eyes and feed them to the ravens, you creature!
I'll behead you and put your head on display!
I will shatter your bones and scatter them to the wind!
I'll crush your bones and throw the corpses to the dogs!
I will cut you in two and throw your parts to the dogs!
I'll tear you to pieces with pleasure, you cowardly brat!
I'll crunch your bones like dry branches!
