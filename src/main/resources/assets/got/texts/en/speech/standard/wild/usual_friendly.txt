Will you fight with us, #?
Warriors of great strength, such as you, are welcome in these lands.
Enemies can't handle our power!
All these filthy animals will perish before our might!
Welcome to our lands, #, friend.
The blood of our enemies will soon be shed.
Can you fight like our warriors?
We shall rule, and the lands of our enemies shall burn!
We are glad to see that you are the enemy of our enemies, #.
Our people will soon rise again!
Death to our enemies!
Are you a warrior, #?
You are welcome in our lands.
You look like a warrior, #.
What do you want?
I've drunk the blood of my enemies many times, and I'll try again!
I have broken many heads in battle. And you, #?
