How dare you be here, you bastard! Get out!
Don't even try to pretend to be a good person. We know what you've done!
How dare you be here? Get out!
We know everything, you lying bitch. Go back where you came from!
Do you really think we'll tolerate your presence here? Get out now!
Traitors and creatures have no place here! We don't trust you or your kind!
Why are you here, you miserable brat? Get out of here!
You will always be an enemy to me. Leave or I'll have to use force!
You have no right to set foot on this land. Get out or I'll force you out!
I despise you and all who are like you. You have no place among us!
