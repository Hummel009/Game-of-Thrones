Don't even try to pretend to be one of us. We know what you're up to, so get out!
Do you really think we'll tolerate your presence? You are an enemy, so get out!
Your presence here offends us. You do not belong to our people, so leave!
Your deeds are known to us. You are not one of us, so go away and don't come back!
Your words are as false as you are. We don't trust strangers like you!
You dare to come here? How dare you, stranger! Go away!
You dare to come here? How dare you, stranger! Get out!
You, stranger, have no right to set foot on this land. Get out or I'll throw you out by force!
I'll never accept you, you're an enemy of our people. Go away or I'll have to use force!
I despise you and all those like you. You don't deserve to be among us!
