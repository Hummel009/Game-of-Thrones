Hello, #. I am Ellaria Sand, beloved of Oberyn Martell and mother of his three daughters. It's widely believed that Oberyn was born to wander and his brother Doran to rule. But I don't agree with that. Our prince is weak and infirm. He's incapable of violence and he lets his enemies get away with it. But there must be someone who will cut off the head of the vicious serpent that seeks to destroy House Martell?
